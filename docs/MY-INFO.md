## About — Bio

```
Paragraph 1 — Who you are / what drives you:
Curiosity and the drive to learn are the most valuable skills for any
developer. That hunger to understand how things work, to find clever
workarounds, and to constantly push boundaries — that's what makes
this craft so rewarding. I live for that moment when something
finally clicks.

Paragraph 2 — How you learned / your background:
I push my limits by joining hackathons with friends and colleagues,
and shipping side projects whenever an idea strikes. Learning from
other teams' decks, studying how things are built, and connecting
with people who are sharper than me — that's my real curriculum.
It never ends, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Paragraph 3 — A turning point in your career:
Being mentored by a senior in Web3 (StarCi) changed how I think
about building software. It showed me that the right path is rarely
the obvious one — and that growth comes from asking better questions,
not just writing more code. That guidance pointed me toward Sui
Blockchain, and I've been going deeper ever since.

Paragraph 4 — What you do now / what you offer:
I'm currently a Software Engineer at CommandOSS, building on Sui
Blockchain. I'm fortunate to work alongside an incredibly talented
and driven team — Toan, Ben, Nikola, Alvin, Henry, Maverick, Jarden,
Max, Theodore — and to learn from sharp peers like Zan, Rowan, and
William. This team pushes me to be better every single day.

Paragraph 5 — Closing thought:
I keep building the impossible, side by side with my darling —
the person who has walked with me through this past year, and whom
I will always remember and forever love. "HM". If any of this work
resonates with you, let's connect and build something great together.
